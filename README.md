R shiny app displaying the upcoming shows from pitchfork
=========

The project was documented in my blog [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/07/no-more-finding-out-about-a-concert-too-late.html). Here is a [link](https://runzemc.shinyapps.io/pitchfork/) to the finished app.

The function used to crawl the tour announcement data from pitchfork is included in `global.R`. The `www` folder includes the css theme used for the app.

Rock on!
